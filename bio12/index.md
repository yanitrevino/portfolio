Check out this [R Notebook](file:///Users/yanitrevino/Downloads/My%20Summer'22%20R%20Notebook.nb.html) I just made!

Here is a paragraph or two introducing the Notebook - explain what you were working on, why you're interested, and/or what the most exciting results are.

This demo Notebook is just illustrating what an R Notebook looks like and how to link to it.
