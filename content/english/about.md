I am currently an undergraduate student at Clovis Community College working towards an AS-T in biology. Included I have assembled a portfolio of research projects from my time so far at Clovis Community in biology and chemsitry.

**Mission**

I am interested in medicine and transcriptomics. At my time at Clovis Community I realized that I had a great interest in doing research during a tap water research group project facilitated by the College's Chemsitry department. I was lucky enough to do more research in a Bio11A class. I always new I wanted to go down the pre-med route because I've always believed that treating the sick is one of the most honorable duties a person could have in life. But by doing research about the genome I've come to learn that there is a big shift coming to medicine: being able to treat patients by looking at their genome. I hope to one day play an essential role in this shift.
